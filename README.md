This project started as a python OOP project for class (see other repo titled: "  ") but once complete I redid the project in Java in order to learn the fundamentals of the language. 

**Play**
Run Main.java to play as a wizard. 
The battle begins with each creature taking turns to make their attack. When it is the wizards turn, you will be prompted to enter a move.
The battle is lost and the game finishes if the Wizard dies.
